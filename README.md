# 369

The Universal 369 Matrix (u369m) Written by: The Lonely Programmer

This program finds the u369m sequence variables Nikoli Tesla spoke about.

********* User must be able to navigate the terminal or command prompt without help. *********

The algorithm finds the u369m sequence within a set of numbers starting from 0 and finishes at whatever number the user inputs. Written in both c and python. This project is for research and experimental purposes and may be used in both personal and business projects. This use of the equation, concept, and or program is completely free and may be used for commerical purposes without referencing original writer. All ASCII art if replicated must be referenced to the creator. The program glitches when trying to calculate numbers larger than 7 digits long on certain devices. Each variables is at a position of every 3rd beat.



Both files to be run via terminal(Unix or Linux) and or command prompt(microsoft).

Compile via terminal within the file location: gcc 369.c -o 369
