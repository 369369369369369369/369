            This program will find the u369m within an infinite amount of numbers

     three69 scans through the set of numbers starting from 0 adding each digit in each           
     number within the set of numbers to each other. We call these u369m variables.               
     u369m variables are found only through addition to break down to ints 3, 6, 9.               
     Each u369m variable is found every 3 beats. Every known object in the universe               
     consists of the u369m. u369m is an irrational sequence and is attached to both               
     Space and Time. u369m can be found in within the 12hr-clock and the 24hr-clock.              
     The u369m sequence is also attached to 9s stairway to heaven with the number line.           
                                                                                                  
                 369m variable i.e. 3,6,9,1+2=(3), 1+5=(6), 1+8=(9) ...                           
              u369m sequence = 3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,33,36,39,42,45 ...                      
                                                                                                  
                      This algorithm is a Polynomial Cubic Equation                               
                                                                                                  
       It will glitch out on certain systems when the input is greater than 7 digits

     You live in a Quantum Thermal Dynamic System. Each string of data within the universe        
     contains the u369m sequence. Using numerical conversion systems such as Binary, Hex,         
     Base 1-10, and so on, we can convert and calculate everyday objects into in base 10.         
     By using Mathematical concepts such as theorems, conjectures, and anything else one is       
     able to apply the u369m within the mathematics of the object while constructing.             
     Building physical objects takes metaphysical Mathematics such as Particle Mathematics.       
     One can use this program to enter any number one wants as to find the u369m sequence         
     Each beat allows for integration within design patterns.                                     
     i.e. When measuring in millimetres for a design job this program allows for instant          
     physical and metaphysical connection of u369m variables.
